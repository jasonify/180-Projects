## 180 Days - 180 Projects (Art/Design/Code/Engineering)


The goal is to learn every day and release something every single day.

The minimum time is 1.5hr and the deadline is before I go to sleep :) but let's call it 6am PST. There are no late days.

I wan to push myself to learn new things and combine art + code + design + engineering.

1) There must be some (mostly) original creative component in the form of either:
  i) art ii) design iii) photography iv) music v) etc
2) Code must be written and open sourced but it can be for a number of things and not limited to: 
  i) website ii) mobile apps iii) arduino projects iv) games v) etc
3)  A short little blog post will be done. Hopefully it will include things like videos / pictures.

4) The projects should include at least 30 minutes of "engineering" and at least 30 minutes of "art" so it should be pretty balanced.

I need to keep in mind that I need to make mistakes and that some projects will be really really bad.

* Should be done within the spirit of "from start to finish" in one day. So mostly original from day to day (can reuse some assets though, libs, characters, etc). Can be inspired by old ideas / sketches / work.
* Should be fully focused, and limit the "tutorial watching" to more actual doing an experimenting by trial and error.
* Great artists steal.

* Not a master artist so goal is to be a bit embarrassed by what I put out.

I am taking inspiration from many that have come before me :)  who have done the daily "do a something" for xxx days/life.

Projects that don't have an actual website will redirect to tumblr :)
