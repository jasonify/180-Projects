## 365 Days - 365 Projects (Art/Design/Code/Engineering)

The goal is to learn every day and release something every single day.
The minimum time is 1.5hr and the deadline is before I go to sleep :) but let's call it 6am PST. There are no late days.


I wan to push myself to learn new things and combine art + code + design + engineering.

1) There must be some (mostly) original creative component in the form of either:
   i) art ii) design iii) photogrpahy iv) music v) etc
2) Code must be written and open sourced but it can be for a number of things and not limited to: 
   i) website ii) mobile apps iii) arduino projects iv) games v) etc
3)  A short little blog post will be done. Hopefully it will include things like videos / pictures. 

4) The projects should include at least 30 minutes of "engineering" and at least 30 minutes of "art" so it should be pretty balanced.



I need to keep in mind that I need to make mistakes and that some projects will be really really bad. 




I am taking inspiration from many that have come before me :)  who have done the daily "do a something" for xxx days/life. 



Projects that don't have an actual wbsite will redirect to tumblr :)
